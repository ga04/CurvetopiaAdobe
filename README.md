To solve the problems outlined in the document, you'll need to follow a series of steps that involve reading the input data, processing it to identify and regularize shapes, and then comparing your output to the provided solutions. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Step-by-Step Guide
Read the Input Data:

Use the provided CSV files to read the raw data points for the curves.
Each CSV file represents a set of points that form polylines (curves).
Regularize Curves:

Identify and straighten common shapes in the curves, such as straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and star shapes.
You can use mathematical methods to detect these shapes based on the points' properties.
Explore Symmetry:

Check for reflection symmetries in closed shapes.
Identify lines of symmetry where the shape can be divided into mirrored halves.
Complete Incomplete Curves:

Develop algorithms to fill in gaps in curves caused by occlusion.
Handle different levels of shape occlusion, from fully contained to partially contained and disconnected shapes.
Compare with Expected Results:

Use the provided solution files (*_sol.csv and *_sol.svg) to compare your output.
Evaluate the accuracy of your results by visualizing and comparing them to the expected solutions.

1. Reading CSV Files
2. Identifying Shapes
Next, you'll need to develop algorithms to identify and regularize shapes. For example, to detect circles, you can use the least squares method to fit a circle to a set of points.

3. Exploring Symmetry
To find lines of symmetry, you can compare points on either side of a potential symmetry line.

4. Completing Curves
For completing curves, you can use interpolation methods to fill in gaps. For example, spline interpolation can be used to smoothly connect points.

Using Provided Solution Files
After processing the curves, compare your results to the provided solution files to ensure accuracy.
